Here are some useful commands:
	git-init(1) to create a new repository.
	git-show-branch(1) to see where you are.
	git-log(1) to see what happened.
	git-checkout(1) and git-branch(1) to switch branches.
	git-add(1) to manage the index file.
	git-diff(1) and git-status(1) to see what you are in the middle of doing.
	git-commit(1) to advance the current branch.
	git-reset(1) and git-checkout(1) (with pathname parameters) to undo changes.
	git-merge(1) to merge between local branches.
	git-rebase(1) to maintain topic branches.
	git-tag(1) to mark known point.

I would suggest a GUI though, unless you are a fan of the command line.
Here is roughly what I've been doing in Cola (Gnome Git GUI)
	Open Cola
	*Checkout* the branch that I'm working on
	*Pull* changes to ensure you have the most up to date copy
	Make your file changes (oh, and save them)
	*Stage* the changes
	Enter a good commit message (describe the changes...well)
	*Commit* the changes
	*Push* the changes
	Go to the Wiki for that module and update what's going on with it.
